This is the README.md file for the Github instance of the R optimx package by John C. Nash

In this repository are developmental versions of the optimx files. The CRAN version of the
package is at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optimx/  

Because CRAN has many requirements to ensure consistency of the collective of packages, some
of the features of the files here may not work with all CRAN packages, even if they provide
corrections or updates to different algorithms.

I welcome suggestions, especially accompanied by small code snippets that let me test the
ideas.  profjcnash _at_ gmail.com  2024-3-15
